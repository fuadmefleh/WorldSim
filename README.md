# WorldSim
This is a world simulation engine that creates a procedural world that then has GameAgents living, exploring, trading, growing, and dying on it. Everything happens at the turn level where a turn is about 1 week. Some things are currently exaggerated like population growth per turn. New features like weather impact, dynamic forces and expansion of all features will happen over time.

# WorldSim
World Simulation Engine, an intricate and dynamic system that crafts procedural worlds teeming with life and activity. This advanced engine breathes life into an entire ecosystem, creating an immersive universe where various 'GameAgents' exist, interact, evolve, and expire. These agents represent a vast array of living entities, who navigate, trade, grow, and meet their end in this procedurally generated realm.

Our simulation operates on a turn-based system, with each turn approximating to a real-world week. This structure provides a sense of time and progress, allowing events and developments to unfold naturally and progressively. From the gradual growth of civilizations to the subtle evolution of the environment, every aspect of the world follows a realistic timeline.

However, for the sake of simulation dynamics, some elements are currently exaggerated. For instance, population growth might seem accelerated, with a notable increase each turn. This is to ensure that the player experiences the transformation of the world within a reasonable time frame.

Over time, the simulation will expand and evolve, with new features and improvements continuously being integrated. Weather effects are among the upcoming additions to the simulation. They will not only add to the visual aesthetics but will also have a practical impact on the world and its inhabitants. GameAgents will have to adapt and respond to changing weather conditions, adding a layer of realism and unpredictability to the simulation.

The addition of dynamic forces is another promising enhancement on the horizon. These forces will serve to shape the world, influencing the movement and behavior of GameAgents, and adding a new dimension of strategy and planning to the gameplay.

Overall, the World Simulation Engine is a constantly evolving project, striving to expand and enhance all features to provide a richer, more immersive experience. We believe in the power of interactive storytelling and the potential of procedural generation to create endless possibilities. Whether you're a player seeking a unique gaming experience, or a developer aiming to build on our engine, we invite you to join us on this exciting journey.
